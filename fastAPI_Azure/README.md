# SRE Challenge

## The Challenge

This repository contains a very simple Python FastAPI application. The task is to containerize this application and deploy the resulting image to a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Application edpoints should be accessible via curl.

## Instructions

- Fork this repository to your personal version control account (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
- Create all the code related to this task.
- Create a README-SOLUTION.md file in the root of the repository with the following information:
  - How to run the code
  - How to deploy the application
  - How to verify that the application is running
  - Any other relevant information

## The Requirements

- Containerize application. Use any container registry you want (e.g. DockerHub).
- The values for the environment variable in the Python script can be random but you should think about security and best practices.
- The application must be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart (use any Kubernetes cluster of your choice: minikube/any cloud provider).
- The application should be exposed and accessible via a curl.
- Terraform must be used to manage the deployment to the Kubernetes cluster. Please follow the best practices.

## Good to have

- The Helm chart and Terraform code should be reusable across environments.
- Describe any tradeoffs you have made in your solution and the way you'd like to improve it for the real production environment.

## Important

- Feel free to change code if you think it is necessary.
- Feel free to use any LLM but document it in the README-SOLUTION.md file.

## Note

- We expect you not to spend more than 4 hours for this task.
